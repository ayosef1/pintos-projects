               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

/* Size of word used frequently when pushing to stack*/

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

The only difference from argument passing style of 80x86 described in
Section 3.5 of the Pintos reference is that we order the tokenized
literals in the opposite direction. This means we push words of
the command in left to right order (whereas 3.5 does it in right to left).

We implement this by tokenizing and pushing each word of the command onto
the stack, each time incrementing our argument counter. In order to tokenize
we first allocate a page to have an copyable version of the command string.
Similarly, we allocate a page to store the addresses of each word of the 
command pushed to the stack. The order of the addresses in this page are the
same as the order that they are pushed.

Next, we add the padding by looking at the current stack addres and rounding
down to the nearest word size (4 for our 32-bit x86 simulators). We then copy
each of the addresses of the arguments from the page we allocated onto the
stack. To do this in the correct order, we start from the last address we
added to the page of addresses, and iterate backwards (using the stored number
of arguments to do so). 

Finally we push argv, argc and the null return address.

Since we know that the command line length is not greater than a page itself,
once we have pushed all the arguments to the page, we then know how much more
space will have to be allocated (4 bytes for each argument, 12 bytes for return
argv, argcc and then however many padding bytes). If total bytes is greater
than the number of pages then we return false.

                 SYSTEM CALLS
                 ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
